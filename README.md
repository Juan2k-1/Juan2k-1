## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I define myself as a technology enthusiast eager to learn from my professional field and expand my knowledge. I have experience in programming with various languages, such as Java, Python, C++, C#, as well as working with different database management systems like PostgreSQL, OracleDB, or MongoDB, and tools and frameworks such as Spring, React Native, Bootstrap, and Thymeleaf.

I would like to find a company where I can develop my potential as a professional, encounter new challenges, and grow both professionally and personally.

Below are some of my standout projects carried out throughout my career.
